# to do, recreate interactive figure for 2020, using csv dataset
# add daily normal distribution of soil moisture, soil temp and modeled/measured soil resp
# add menu and many things...

# Idea for manuscript: 
# Model Rsoil with DAMM using ANN estimated distributions of Tsoil and SWC
# --> show how it perform better than using a single value of Tsoil and SWC
# --> suggest to use it for ESM/LSM subgrids
